B. PURPOSE OF SOFTWARE
  Creation of a library for the matrix functions in C and C++.
  - Matrix addition, transposition, multiplication
  

C. FILES
  - Matrix.h is the header file for the C++ Matrix class
  - Matrix_cppversion.cpp is the C++ source file implementing the Matrix class 
  - main.cpp is an example use case for the CPP version of the matrix library
  - matrix_cversion.h is the header file for the C matrix implementation
  - matrix_cversion.c is the C source file implementing matrix operations
  - main.c is an example use case for the C version of the matrix library
  - makefile is used for the compilation of both versions, producing two executables

D. BUILD INSTRUCTIONS
  1. Download all files into a directory.
  2. Open terminal in the directory
  3. Type "make" into terminal.
  4. Type "./matrix_cppver" to run the main.cpp file.
  5. Type "./matrix_cver" to run the main.c file.
  6. (Optional) Type "make clean" to clear compiled files.

E. Testing Methods
  Using the example matrices and operations, I created a main file for both C++ and C to display the resulting matrix of the equation. 

F. ADDITIONAL INFO
  This was built on a Windows machine, not Apple, using VSC.
